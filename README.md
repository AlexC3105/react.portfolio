## Usage

1. Start the development server:

Copy code

This will start the development server and open the portfolio in your default browser. You can view and interact with the portfolio locally. Any changes you make to the code will trigger a hot-reloading of the app.

2. Customize the portfolio:
- Replace the content in the `public/` and `src/` directories with your own information, images, and components.
- Modify the styling in the CSS files (`App.css`, `index.css`, etc.) to match your desired design.
- Add or remove components as needed to customize the structure and functionality of your portfolio.

3. Build the production-ready app:
npm run build

less
Copy code

This command creates a production-ready build of your app in the `build/` directory. The optimized and minified code is suitable for deployment to a web server.
